  <H1> My Hopes for After College...</h1>
<p> After I graduate from Umaine, I hope to find a job as quickly as possible in order to pay off student loans and purchase things on my own such as a reliable car, maybe an apartment closer to a city and just be able to support myself financially. 
	<p> I also hope to find a job in the business marketing field that I enjoy and have interest in, I know that it is a rareity right out of college. My dream job is to be hired by a luxury car company's marketing team and pitch ideas for advertisments.
