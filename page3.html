<h2> Schooling... </h2>

<p> Since I lived in Pembroke, I attended the public schools in my school district. Those including, North Pembroke Elementary, Pembroke Middle School and lastly, Pembroke High School. 
 </p>
<p> In 2016, I graduated from PHS with acceptance to Bridgewater State Universty. At the time I had also been accepted to Umaine, but chose to attend Bridgewater due to the fact that I never got the chance to tour Umaine. </p>

<p> In my fall semester at BSU, I came to the conclusion that the school's atmosphere was not what I had pictured when I imagined college. So i began my search for a new school that embodied what I wanted in a college. That being school spirit, further from home, and a larger school than the one I had been attending. I knew Umaine was going to be a perfect fit when I came up to visit the following February, right after a snow storm had come through campus. I saw the snow and how beautiful the campus was and immedietly fell in love with it. I am thus far, very happy with my new begining here at Umaine.
