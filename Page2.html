<h2> A Little Bit About My Past... </h2>

<p> I grew up in a small town called Pembroke, it's population size is about 18,358 (2016). Although my immediate family is not from pembroke, we have lived there now for 18 years. We are originally from Quincy, Massachusetts. Quincy is a city north of Pembroke and closer to the heart of Boston, where my father is employed as a detective for the city of Quincy. </p>

<p>	
My immediate family consists of my father and mother, John II and Maria as well as my two odler brothers, John III (25) and Brendan (21). We also like to consider our family dog, Boomer the chocolate lab (11) a family member as well.  </p>
